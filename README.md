## Project Overview

This project is a **binary image classification system** that detects flooding from images. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, the model classifies images into two categories:

- **Flooding**
- **No Flooding**

The system leverages modern deep learning techniques, including:

- Pre-trained CNN backbones (e.g., MobileNet, ResNet)
- Global Average Pooling
- Dropout regularization
- Categorical cross-entropy loss for classification

---

## Features

- Binary classification of images for flooding detection
- Uses transfer learning for faster and more accurate training
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- Easy to extend for multi-class classification

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.12+
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- OpenCV (optional, for image preprocessing)
